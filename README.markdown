## 🧠 Overview

**Tic Tac Toe** is a classic two-player game implemented in **C++** using the **VCL framework**. Players take turns placing `'X'` or `'O'` on a 3×3 grid, trying to align three identical symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The game features a polished graphical interface, visual turn indicators, and automatic win detection.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Graphical Interface**: Uses BMP images for `X`, `O`, and empty tiles.
- 🔄 **Turn Indicator**: Shows current player with a mini-icon.
- 🧠 **Win Detection**: Automatically checks for 8 possible winning conditions.
- ♻️ **Reset Function**: Easily restart the game with one click.
