<br># Tic Tac Toe<br><br>## Overview<br>"Tic Tac Toe" is a classic two-player game implemented in C++ using the VCL framework. Players alternate placing 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game includes graphical images, a turn indicator, and win detection.<br><br>## Features<br>- **Graphical Interface**: Uses BMP images for 'X', 'O', and empty fields.<br>- **Turn Indicator**: Displays current player's turn with a small 'X' or 'O' image.<br>- **Win Detection**: Checks 8 winning combinations after each move.<br>- **Reset Functionality**: Restart the game with a single button click.<br><br>## Requirements<br>- C++ compiler with VCL support (e.g., Embarcadero C++ Builder)<br>- Windows OS<br>- Image files (`nic.bmp`, `x.bmp`, `o.bmp`, `xsmall.bmp`, `osmall.bmp`) in an `img` folder<br><br>## Installation<br>1. Clone the repository:<br>   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
   <br>2. Ensure the `img` folder with required BMP files is in the project directory.<br>3. Open the project in Embarcadero C++ Builder.<br>4. Build and run the application.<br><br>## How to Play<br>- Launch the game; the circle ('O') starts.<br>- Click an empty square to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').<br>- The turn indicator shows whose turn is next.<br>- The game ends when a player aligns three symbols or the grid is full.<br>- Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.<br><br>## Files<br>- `Unit1.cpp`: Main game logic and event handlers.<br>- `Unit1.h`: Form definitions and component declarations.<br>- `img/`: Folder containing BMP images for game visuals.<br><br>## Contributing<br>Contributions are welcome!
